# Kami Capes

This is a project to make for more accessible user-made capes, while still allowing for some kind of rarity. This project is heavily geared twards anarchy servers

# How Do I Get a Cape?

You can either:

  1. Submit an original cape (not in this github) that follows the guidelines as an issue
  2. Ask someone who has claimed a cape if you can use theirs

I will not make a cape for you.

# How Do I See My Cape?

You'll need to use a mod that links to our ``capes.json`` file. I'll make one sometime soon and link the jarfile here, along with the source if you want to build it yourself. Right now if you want to use it, the easiest way is to download kami blue's source and replace the capes link with this one in ``kamimod.java``, and then compile it.

# Cape Submission Guidelines

  - First person to submit a given cape gets dibs on all future uses of that cape unless they state they want it to be a public cape. No exceptions. 
  - All capes must fall within the 64x32 size originaly made by Moyang. Exceptions can be made for custom clients, if you want to use this list, but it is generaly encouraged to keep your capes similar at least in spirit to the original style put forth by Moyang. Exceptions will absolutly not be made for groups or individuals. Don't bother asking if you are one.
  - No capes designs currently in use by Moyang, Optifine, or any other client cape you pay money for (Future, WWE, Kamiblue ect.) may be submitted. No Minecon capes, no Optifine capes, no Translator capes, no bacon capes, ect. If you really want a cape, get creative. They're fun to make. Look around at the capes in here for inspiration if you want - just remember to make the cape your own.
  -No NSFW content on the cape. Dicks aren't funny anymore. Grow up.
